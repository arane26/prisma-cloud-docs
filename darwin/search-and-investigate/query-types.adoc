== Query Types

The Investigate page includes *Simple Mode* (filter-based) and *RQL Mode* (RQL text-based) options for building queries. All the simple mode inputs can be converted to RQL queries, while only certain RQL queries can be converted to simple mode. 

As you type in your query, Prisma Cloud will automatically provide you with query completion options with the supported query attributes. 

Prisma Cloud supports the following query types:

[cols="20%a,30%a,30%a,20%a"]

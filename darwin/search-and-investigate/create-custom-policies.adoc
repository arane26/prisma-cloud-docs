== Create Custom Policies

On the Investigate page, you can: 

[.procedure]

. *Create a policy* from a specific query:
.. run a query tentatively (to see if modifications are needed)
.. save the satisfied query as a Saved Search
.. convert a Saved Search into a policy

. To *Download* results for a long-runnning query for post processing (e.g. for compliance purposes):
.. run a query tentatively (to see if modifications are needed)
.. click on download button to download all results in the table

. To explore/investigate resources adhoc and does not have a download/policy creation purpose:
.. run a query tentatively (to see if modifications are needed)
.. click on specific resources to explore further in Resource Explorer

//Currently none of the above use cases could work for big queries, which take a long time to run and often time out due to the current performance limitations.
